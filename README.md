# VoxelWorld

VoxelWorld is a Godot testproject for learning
 - How to create dynamic meshes
 - How to implement the MarchingCubes algorithm
 - How to make the terrain editabe

At the moment it looks like a Minecraft clone, but when everything else works, I will try to generate a smooth editable voxel terrain (like in Space Engineers).
Maybe some day it will become a real game...
